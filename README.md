## üìù About This Nano-Degree

The Deep Learning Nanodegree program offers you a solid introduction to the world of artificial intelligence. In this program, you‚Äôll master fundamentals that will enable you to go further in the field, launch or advance a career, and join the next generation of deep learning talent that will help define a beneficial, new, AI-powered future for our world. You will study cutting-edge topics such as Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Network Deployment, and build projects in PyTorch and NumPy. You‚Äôll learn from authorities such Ian Goodfellow and Jun-Yan Zhu, inventors of types of generative adversarial networks, as well as AI experts, Sebastian Thrun and Andrew Trask. For anyone interested in this transformational technology, this program is an ideal point-of-entry. The program is comprised of 5 courses and 5 projects. Each project you build will be an opportunity to prove your skills and demonstrate what you‚Äôve learned in your lessons.

## üìù About This Course
### üåü Convolutional Neural Networks

Learn how to build convolutional networks and use them to classify images (faces, melanomas, etc.) based
on patterns and objects that appear in them. Use these networks to learn data compression and image
denoising.

## üìù About This Project
### ‚úî Dog Breed Classifier

In this project, you will define a Convolutional Neural Network that
performs better than the average human when given the task:
identifying dog breeds. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm
will produce an estimate of the dog‚Äôs breed. If supplied an image of
a human, the code will *also* produce an estimate of the closestresembling dog breed. Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN
models for classification, you will make important design decisions
about the user experience for your app.
