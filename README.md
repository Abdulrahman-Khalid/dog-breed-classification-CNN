## üìù About This Nano-Degree

Become an expert in neural networks, and learn to implement them using the deep learning framework PyTorch. Build convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent networks for sequence generation, generative adversarial networks for image generation, and learn how to deploy models accessible from a website.

## üìù About This Course
### üåü Convolutional Neural Networks

Learn how to build convolutional networks and use them to classify images (faces, melanomas, etc.) based
on patterns and objects that appear in them. Use these networks to learn data compression and image
denoising.

## üìù About This Project
### ‚úî Dog Breed Classifier

In this project, you will define a Convolutional Neural Network that
performs better than the average human when given the task:
identifying dog breeds. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm
will produce an estimate of the dog‚Äôs breed. If supplied an image of
a human, the code will *also* produce an estimate of the closestresembling dog breed. Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN
models for classification, you will make important design decisions
about the user experience for your app.
